## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```
---
# 2. Configure the Database (Optional)
 By default, the application is configured to use the H2 in-memory database. No setup is required for this.

If you want to use a different database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, you need to:

Update the src/main/resources/application.properties file with your database credentials.

Properties
```bash

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/todo_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

```

 # 3. Build and Run the Application
 ---
You can run the application using your IDE or the command line.

Using Maven:

```Bash

mvn spring-boot:run
```
---
The application will start on http://localhost:8080.
---

üïπÔ∏è Usage
*Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

*Homepage (/ or /todos): Displays the list of all to-do items.

*Add Task: Use the form on the homepage to add a new task.

*Update Status: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete or incomplete.

*Delete Task: Click the delete button to remove a task.

*The application follows a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
